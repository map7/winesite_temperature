* Winesite temperature

Based on the Adafruit DHT python code I've re-written this in ruby to suit my needs.

This program should read the temperature and humidity from the sensor, then post it to my winesite using Mechanize to send temperatures.

1. Gets temperature on Raspberry PI with TEMP sensor
2. Get settings from ~/.winesite
3. Signs in
4. Posts form to temperature with the following data
   | field       |
   |-------------|
   | cellar_id   |
   | datetime    |
   | temperature |
   | humidity    |

** .winesite config

: {
:         "url":"http://<winesite URL>",
:         "cellar":"<cellar id to log temperature for>",
:         "email":"<email for user login>",
:         "password":"<my password for the site>"
: }
